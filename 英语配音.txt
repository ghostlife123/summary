hope look at me
I'm expendable
That's why I'm here
You must've realized that by now
I mean that's why I'm in the suit and you are not
he'd rather lose this fight than lose you



See whatever you are doing, however you spend your time that tells who you are.
So think about what it is you like to create your life experience.
Once I look at how you commit your time 
Once I do an evaluation on how you spend your time, I can tell you exactly what you're committed to.
How much time do you spend working on you?
How much time do you spend every day working on your dream?
In the last 90 days, how many books have you read?
In the last year, what new skills or knowledge have you acquired?
What kind of investment have you made in you?
A lot of people, as soon as, they punch out, they rush home to sit on the couch,
they rush home to do nothing, they rush home just to sit there and figure out,
"Ok, I'm gonna to go sleeping, do it all tomorrow."
You have to give it everything you got,No more TV, no more parties, no more play
If you don't work well,what you need to be doing is studying
This is a life class that means we have an opportunity to learn how to maximize our lives, 
think of the things that you are doing that somebody else can be doing, 
and think of yourself as a precious commodity that you've gonna reserve your energy for your highest and best use
